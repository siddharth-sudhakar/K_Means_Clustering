# K_Means_Clustering
This project aims to create a targeted ad marketing campaign for a company by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups. This is achieved through data collected over a duration of 2.5 years.
This was a part of my guided projects course 'Modern Artificial Intelligence Masterclass' on Udemy.
