# K_Means_Clustering
This project aims to create a targeted ad marketing campaign for a company by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups. This is achieved through data collected over a duration of 2.5 years. Concepts learned are:
  1. K-Means Clustering
  2. Principal Component Analysis
  3. Auto-encoders
This was a part of my guided projects course 'Modern Artificial Intelligence Masterclass' on Udemy.
